# Basic Azure Onboarding

This repository documents my experience with **Microsoft Azure** onboarding, carried out in a DIO lab environment. During this process, I explored some key services and initial configurations, including setting up a subscription, using Azure Bastion, configuring Azure Virtual Desktop, exploring the "All Services" tab, and creating a virtual machine.

## Topics Covered

1. **Azure Subscription**: 
   - Creation and activation of a basic subscription to access Azure resources.

2. **Azure Virtual Desktop**: 
   - Initial configuration of the remote desktop environment to facilitate access and work on virtual desktops.

3. **"All Services" Tab (Network and Compute)**: 
   - Navigation through the tab to explore resources and discover tools in Networking and Compute.

4. **Creating a Virtual Machine (VM)**: 
   - Step-by-step configuration and launch of a VM with basic networking and storage options.

5. **Azure Bastion**: 
   - Use of Bastion for secure connections to virtual machines without exposing public IPs.

## Process Overview

### 1. Azure Subscription
   - **Experience**: I started by creating a free Azure subscription, which granted access to various resources and trial credits. This step is essential for accessing the portal and resources.

### 2. Azure Virtual Desktop Configuration
   - **Experience**: I set up Azure Virtual Desktop to access a remote work environment, enabling cloud-based desktops that can be accessed from anywhere.

### 3. Exploring "All Services"
   - **Experience**: In the "All Services" tab, I explored the **Networking** and **Compute** sections, where I discovered resources like virtual machines, virtual networks, and Bastions.

### 4. Creating a Virtual Machine (VM)
   - **Experience**: I created my first virtual machine by following the recommended steps in the portal. I set the operating system, size, and basic networking and storage configurations.

### 5. Azure Bastion Configuration
   - **Experience**: I configured **Azure Bastion** to connect to virtual machines securely without exposing public IPs.
